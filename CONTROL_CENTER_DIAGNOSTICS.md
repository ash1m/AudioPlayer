# Control Center / Lock Screen Media Controls Diagnosis

## Current Issues Identified

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several potential issues that could prevent media controls from appearing on the lock screen and Control Center:

### 1. **Audio Session Timing Issues**
- The audio session is set up correctly but may not be active at the right time
- Controls are configured before the audio session is fully established
- The `ensureAudioSessionAndRemoteControlsActive()` method has logical issues

### 2. **Remote Command Center Setup Issues**
- Commands are disabled and then re-enabled which might cause timing issues
- `removeTarget(nil)` might not be the correct way to clear targets
- Initial "dummy" Now Playing info might interfere with actual playback

### 3. **Now Playing Info Update Issues**
- Multiple `updateNowPlayingInfo()` calls might conflict
- The "force set" approach in `loadAudioFile()` might override the proper info
- Folder progress calculations might produce invalid values for Control Center

### 4. **Missing Audio Session Delegate**
- No proper handling of audio session deactivation/reactivation cycles
- Missing proper audio session category options for media controls

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Improve Audio Session Setup Timing
### Fix 2: Simplify Remote Command Center Configuration  
### Fix 3: Fix Now Playing Info Updates
### Fix 4: Add Audio Session Delegate Support
### Fix 5: Test Control Center Activation

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely causes are:
1. **Timing Issues**: Controls being set up before audio session is fully active
2. **Conflicting Updates**: Multiple Now Playing info updates overriding each other
3. **Invalid Data**: Folder progress calculations providing invalid duration/time values
4. **Session Management**: Audio session not staying active consistently

## Testing Steps

To verify the fixes work:
1. Launch app and load an audio file
2. Start playback
3. Lock device and check lock screen controls
4. Open Control Center and verify media controls appear
5. Test remote command functionality (play, pause, skip, seek)
6. Verify controls work consistently after app backgrounding
